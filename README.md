# **Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction**

## **Problem Statement**
In the competitive mobile phone market companies want to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices. The objective is to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM, Internal Memory, etc) and its selling price. In this problem, we do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.


In this project, we are going to explore and analyze a dataset which contains specifications of two thousand mobile phones and try to predict optimum price ranges for a list of mobile phones in the market by applying various machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, xgboost, gradient boosting and k-nearest neighbors(knn).
